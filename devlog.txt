# Stage Two -

The Director submits a report to the board when they want the green light to bid for a player.
Once they have the financial conditions (max bid and max wage) from the board, they can create a bid and send it to the club or speak to the agent and guage interest.
If the director doesn't already have the agent's or club's contact details, they will have to ask their staff or ask the secretary to find the contact details. They will already have the contact details if they are in the same league.
You can also arrange a face-to-face negotiation and try to do a deal more quickly.

Once a fee is agreed, the use can negotiate a contract with the player and their agent.
Once contract fees are agreed, the player can do a PlayerMedical.
Once the user has received a PlayerMedicalReport and a PlayerPersonalityReport, the transfer can be confirmed, negotiated or cancelled.
