I want to make thi final push towards the products that are on the way.
Director is coming along but I don't have an MVP, let alone something close to a beta.
Soft Power is in its 6th or 7th year now and it is maturing.
My database has been nascient for a while but the game itself only just started coming together.
The database is grindable for a weekend and then I can stick it into a React app and go.
That will be the side project in the short-term.
CHIEF SCOUT has to be the name, I have the dof website but it will expire soon and that's the name of the game.
CHIEF SCOUT 1.0 will be the scouting radar I think.

1. Assess clubs
2. Assess requirements
3. Make suggestions
4. Track progress

# Assess clubs
Each club needs scores for each position

const ChiefScoutAssessClubRequirements = function (ClubID, ClubPositionScores){

}

const ClubPositionScores = {
    ClubID:
    ClubFormation:
    ClubGKScore:
    ClubDRScore:
    ClubDCScore:
    ClubDLScore:
    ClubWBRScore:
    ClubDMScore:
    ClubWBLScore:
    ClubMRScore:
    ClubMCScore:
    ClubMLScore:
    ClubAMRScore:
    ClubAMCScore:
    ClubAMLScore:
    ClubRFScore:
    ClubCFScore:
    ClubLFScore:
}

Each position score is calcluated by taking the average score of the top two players at the club and then applying other factors such as their ages and contract length. For the MVP we can just use the average.

# Determine Requirements
When ClubPositionScores has been calculated, the Chief Scout can create positional requirements by taking the median of the positional scores and looking to address the weakest scores. The weakest position in the team is automatically added to the requirements list, as well as any significantly weak positions and positions when the strongest's player in the position has an expiring contract. 

# Suggest players
Once requirements have been set, the chief scout needs to look at the scouting pool and suggest players that could fulfill the requirements.
These players go onto the primary shortlist.
