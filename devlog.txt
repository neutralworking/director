CHIEF SCOUT 1.0 will be the scouting radar I think.

Chief Scout website workflow can probably be directly through Airtable.
From where it is now I need to do some more tables that will house calculations, and also delete some tables that I'm not using to clear it up a little bit.

I need to take the overall scores that I have and create clubOverallScores, clubPositionalScores etc
I need to add ages in
I can probably do some sort of remaining contract length scrapping from transfermarkt but it's not super important, I can do that manually for now 
Once the requirements, base values and market values are created, I can display some unique information.
Creating these algos are next.
I should do it in python if it's going online as well.
I could probably convert everything at this stage.

ClubHistoricalLevel
I can assign points for each year in the top season and then multiply by the league reputation level.
