Mechanics that I want to create
Training Update: User receives a notification that the daily Training Report is in
Players have a chance to receive a regrading every day, which affects their Scores and changes their likelihood to play.
 


I want to make the final push towards the products that are on the way.
Director is coming along but I don't have an MVP, let alone something close to a beta.
Soft Power is in its 6th or 7th year now and it is maturing.
My database has been nascient for a while but the game itself only just started coming together.
The database is grindable for a weekend and then I can stick it into a React app and go.
That will be the side project in the short-term.
CHIEF SCOUT has to be the name, I have the dof website but it will expire soon and that's the name of the game.
CHIEF SCOUT 1.0 will be the scouting radar I think.

Chief Scout website workflow can probably be directly through Airtable.
From where it is now I need to do some more tables that will house calculations, and also delete some tables that I'm not using to clear it up a little bit.

I need to take the overall scores that I have and create clubOverallScores, clubPositionalScores etc
I need to add ages in
I can probably do some sort of remaining contract length scrapping from transfermarkt but it's not super important, I can do that manually for now 
Once the requirements, base values and market values are created, I can display some unique information.
Creating these algos are next.
I should do it in python if it's going online as well.
I could probably convert everything at this stage.

ClubHistoricalLevel
I can assign points for each year in the top season and then multiply by the league reputation level.


DOF
I need to creata  new dummy database, but it probably pointless until I have the player class finalised.
