The Director submits a report to the board when they want the green light to bid for a player.
Once they have the financial conditions (max bid and max wage) from the board, they can create a bid and send it to the club or speak to the agent and guage interest.
If the director doesn't already have the agent's or club's contact details, they will have to ask their staff or ask the secretary to find the contact details. They will already have the contact details if they are in the same league.
You can also arrange a face-to-face negotiation and try to do a deal more quickly.

Once a fee is agreed, the use can negotiate a contract with the player and their agent.
Once contract fees are agreed, the player can do a PlayerMedical.

Trey Nyoni (Liverpool)
BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella: The 17-year-old midfielder has caught the eye of new manager Arne Slot during pre-season. He excelled in a friendly against Real Betis, which saw him singled out for praise by a manager who is usually reluctant to do so. He also scored in the Reds’ friendly win against Sevilla on Saturday. Nyoni joined Liverpool from Leicester last summer.

Josh Acheampong (Chelsea)
BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella: The 18-year-old defender made his Chelsea debut last season against Tottenham and was one of just two youngsters on tour in the United States from the academy. He is an outstanding athlete who can play centre-back or right-back.

Mikey Moore (Tottenham)
BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella: The 17-year-old forward has been scoring goals under Ange Postecoglou in pre-season. The immensely gifted youngster excelled in the under-21s team that won PL2 last season. He is too young to go out on loan so will probably stay and get a mixed first team and youth role.

Ethan Nwaneri (Arsenal)
BBC Sport's Alex Howell: There's been a lot of expectation around the development of Nwaneri since he became the youngest player in Premier League history when he made his debut for Arsenal at just 15 years and 181 days old in the 2022-23 season.

The 17-year-old made just one appearance last season in the Premier League against West Ham but hopes remain high for the midfielder.

Nwaneri started the Gunners' pre-season friendly against Manchester United in the USA and provided an assist for Gabriel Jesus as Arsenal went on to win the match.

Manager Mikel Arteta has said that Nwaneri and the rest of the young players' futures are in their own hands and they should "show what you can do" in pre-season.

If Nwaneri carries on how he has done so far, there's a chance he will be getting more minutes this season.

Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace)

Adam Wharton says being in England's Euro 2024 squad is 'a dream come true'

BBC Sport's Alex Howell: It's quite remarkable that Adam Wharton only made his Premier League debut in February of this year.

His impressive performances in a short space of time saw him make his England debut and be included in the squad that reached the final of Euro 2024.

Sources at Crystal Palace believe that the 20-year-old is their best signing from the Championship and that is high praise considering Michael Olise came that way and has just secured a move to European giants Bayern Munich.

Then England manager Gareth Southgate said the national team had been missing a player like Wharton for "seven or eight years".

If Wharton continues to flourish like he did in his first few months in the Premier League, a move to one of the division's top sides could not be far away.

Jesurun Rak-Sakyi (Crystal Palace)
BBC Sport's Alex Howell: Being a young winger at Crystal Palace can be hard, especially when the players initially put in front of you when you are trying to break into the team are Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise and Wilfried Zaha.

Rak-Sakyi went on loan to Charlton in League One during the 2022-23 season and won their player of the year award after scoring 15 goals and adding eight assists.

The 21-year-old suffered with injury last season and made just eight appearances across all competitions for the Eagles.

However, he has done well in pre-season, looking at home in Oliver Glasner’s 3-4-3 formation.

Chido Obi-Martin (Man Utd)
BBC Sport's Simon Stone: Arsenal [where Obi-Martin played for the last two years] believe they made a fair offer to the 16-year-old forward, who has represented both England and Denmark at youth level. But he has decided to join Manchester United.

The reasons for this will be debated but Obi-Martin has proved himself to be lethal in youth ranks – he scored 10 goals in a single game against Liverpool Under-16s when he was 15.

It will be fascinating to see how quickly he develops and whether he gets a chance in the EFL Trophy and UEFA Youth League. If he does well there, might we see him on the United first-team bench at some point?

Nico O'Reilly (Manchester City)
BBC Sport's Simon Stone: I am not going against Pep Guardiola. It is a truism with youth players that they have the power to make it impossible to ignore them through the excellence of their performance.

The 19-year-old O'Reilly did just that against Barcelona in Florida. And while a number of senior stars are yet to return to training after the Euros and Copa America, O’Reilly’s performance against the manager's former club is bound to stick with Guardiola.

As a midfielder, he knows a regular first-team slot is impossible for now given Rodri's presence. But he may get opportunities from the bench, especially after another impressive display in the Community Shield win against Man Utd.

Michael Golding (Leicester City)
Leicester's signing of Golding from Chelsea last month was an intriguing one.

The 18-year-old did not make a lasting impression on the first team at Stamford Bridge - making just one appearance as an 89th-minute substitute in a 4-0 FA Cup win over Preston - but has plenty of youth experience with England's age groups.

He will not be expected to fill the gap left by Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who joined Chelsea in July, but as a midfielder who can play as a 10 or a number eight, there is potential for him to become the next box-to-box star for the Foxes.

Eric da Silva Moreira (Nottingham Forest)
Nottingham Forest brought in winger Moreira from St Pauli this summer for less than £2m.

A Germany Under-17 international, he only made his professional debut last season but helped St Pauli win promotion to the Bundesliga for the first time in 13 years.

Moreira, who can also play right-back, helped Germany win the Under-17 European Championship and World Cup last year and joins with winning pedigree for someone who only turned 18 in May.

Pedro Lima (Wolves)
Wolves brought the 18-year-old Lima to Molineux for £8.5m from Sport Recife in July, reportedly snatching him from Chelsea's grasp, and he has impressed in pre-season.

Nelson Semedo’s red card in last season's final-day defeat at Liverpool gives Lima the chance to prove himself at right-back early on, with Semedo banned for the opening three games.

Portugal international Semedo is still likely to regain his place, but Lima is expected to leave a mark this season.

Harrison Armstrong (Everton)
The 18-year-old has impressed in the Everton academy and earned his first professional contract in July, signing a three-year deal.

The midfielder broke into the club's under-21 side last season and has been given a chance to feature in the first team during pre-season.
