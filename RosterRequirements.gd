# Requirements 
If a club has no requirements, no players show up on the radar.
Managers will submit requirements that will help the first team.
Directors will submit requirements that will help publicity and commercial. 
Players can make requirements sometimes if they are homesick or they aren't satisfied.
Fans can make requirements through social media campaigns.

On the requirements screen, the director can choose which requirements to add to the Hitlist.
Requirements on the Hitlist will populate the Scouting Radar.
