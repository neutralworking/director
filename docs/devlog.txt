After giving up on game dev and Godot, I have returned after realising that creating DOF will be easier than creating Chief Scout.
This will take time and effort, which I have in small amounts, whereas Chief Scout will take money, which I don't really.

Refactor List

Director of Football - MVP Refactoring & Development Plan
Based on your stated MVP goals of running a club through multiple seasons with player trading, contract negotiations, staff/chairman meetings, and match simulation, here's your strategic roadmap:

Critical MVP Features (Priority Order)
Phase 1: Core Data Layer (Week 1-2)
Must Build First:

Player Data Structure: Create a clean Player class/resource with essential attributes only (name, age, position, 3-5 key stats like overall rating, potential, wages, contract expiry)

Club Data Structure: Basic club class with squad array, budget, reputation

Save/Load System: Simple JSON-based save system for game state persistence

Data Generator: Script to generate realistic player and club databases for testing

Why This First: Everything else depends on having player and club data. Keep it minimal - resist adding complex stat systems now.

Phase 2: Season Loop & Time Management (Week 2-3)
Build the Core Game Flow:

Calendar/Date System: Simple date progression (weekly increments)

Season Manager: Controls season start/end, fixture generation, league table

Main Game Loop: Weekly cycle where you process matches, then access menus

Basic UI Shell: Main menu with buttons for: Squad, Transfers, Calendar, Finances

Why This Next: This creates the skeleton that everything else plugs into. You need the loop before adding features.

Phase 3: Match Simulation (Week 3-4)
Minimal Match Engine:

Simple Match Sim: Algorithm that takes two squads and generates a scoreline based on team ratings (no need for play-by-play initially)

Match Report Screen: Simple UI showing final score, goalscorers, basic stats

Result Processing: Update league table, player morale/fitness

Keep It Simple: Don't get lost in complex match simulation. A basic algorithm that feels somewhat realistic is enough for MVP.

Phase 4: Transfer System (Week 4-5)
Player Trading Basics:

Transfer Market Screen: Scrollable list of available players with filters (position, price range)

Buy Player Flow: Make offer → simple acceptance logic → add to squad

Sell Player Flow: List player → receive offers → accept/reject

Budget Management: Ensure transactions affect club finances

Scope Control: No loan system, no installments, no release clauses yet. Just cash purchases.

Phase 5: Contract System (Week 5-6)
Contract Negotiations:

Contract Negotiation UI: Offer wages and contract length

Player Response Logic: Simple acceptance based on wages vs. player rating

Contract Expiry Warnings: Alert when contracts running out

Free Agent Signing: Pick up players whose contracts expired

Keep Minimal: One wage figure, one contract length. Don't add bonuses, clauses, or complex negotiations yet.

Phase 6: Meetings System (Week 6-7)
Staff & Chairman Interactions:

Meeting Scheduler: Trigger meetings based on events (poor form, budget requests, etc.)

Meeting UI: Dialogue-style interface with multiple choice responses

Chairman Meeting: Request budget increases, discuss objectives

Staff Meetings: Basic morale updates, training feedback

Content Light: Write 3-4 meeting scenarios maximum. Focus on system working, not content volume.

Key Architectural Principles
Singleton Pattern for Managers: Use Godot autoload for SeasonManager, TransferManager, etc. This gives you global access without tight coupling.

Signal-Based Communication: Use Godot signals for events (player_signed, match_completed, contract_expired). This decouples systems.

Scene-Based UI: Each major screen is its own scene. No mega-scene with everything.

Data-Driven Approach: Store player/club data in JSON or Godot Resources, not hardcoded in scripts.

What to Remove/Avoid (Bloat Reduction)
Delete or Deprioritize:
Complex Training Systems: Skip detailed training mechanics for MVP

Detailed Tactics: No formation customization or tactical instructions initially

Youth Academy: Can wait until post-MVP

Scouting System: Use simple "browse all players" instead

Injuries & Morale: Skip or make extremely simple

Media/Press Conferences: Not essential for core gameplay

Staff Hiring: Assume you have fixed staff

Stadium Management: Ignore completely for MVP

Multiple Leagues/Competitions: One league only

Resist Feature Creep:
Every time you think of adding a feature, ask: "Can I play 2 seasons without this?" If yes, it's not MVP.

Development Best Practices
Weekly Milestones:
Set one clear goal per week

Build vertically (one complete feature) not horizontally (half of everything)

Playtest weekly - can you "play" the game at end of each week?

Code Quality:
Comment your code as you write it

Keep functions small (under 50 lines)

Use meaningful variable names

Don't optimize prematurely

Version Control:
Commit daily with clear messages

Create branches for major features

Tag versions when features are complete

Testing Your MVP
MVP is complete when you can:

Start a new game and select a club

View your squad and finances

Progress through weeks using a "Next Week" button

Watch match results for your fixtures

Browse transfer market and buy a player

Negotiate and sign a player to a contract

Sell a player

Have a meeting with chairman

Complete 2 full seasons

Save and load your game

If you can do all 10 things, you have an MVP.

Next Steps for You
Immediate Actions:

Audit Current Code: List every .gd file in your repo and categorize as "Essential for MVP" or "Not MVP"

Create MVP Branch: Branch from main, start fresh refactor

Build Skeleton First: Get the season loop working with dummy data before adding features

One Feature at a Time: Don't work on transfers and contracts simultaneously

Playtest Constantly: Every Friday, try to "play" what you've built that week



Director of Football
Godot + static DB with data updates and periodic new builds to app stores
Marketing Website Online App to query database - dof.gg

Finish the set of classic players and then have a solid 10,000k DB that will be the base database.
Set number of leagues (Top 5 plus Championship maybe)

I can assign points for each year in the top season and then multiply by the league reputation level.

# Stage Two -

The Director submits a report to the board when they want the green light to bid for a player.
Once they have the financial conditions (max bid and max wage) from the board, they can create a bid and send it to the club or speak to the agent and guage interest.
If the director doesn't already have the agent's or club's contact details, they will have to ask their staff or ask the secretary to find the contact details. They will already have the contact details if they are in the same league.
You can also arrange a face-to-face negotiation and try to do a deal more quickly.

Once a fee is agreed, the use can negotiate a contract with the player and their agent.
Once contract fees are agreed, the player can do a PlayerMedical.
Once the user has received a PlayerMedicalReport and a PlayerPersonalityReport, the transfer can be confirmed, negotiated or cancelled.
