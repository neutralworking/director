## 🎭 5 PURE ARCHETYPES

**Refined to extremes** - no hybrid options. Each is all-in on ONE approach:

### **1. THE SYSTEM** (Tactics Purist)
**Identity**: Perfect system or complete failure. No middle ground.

**WHEN Squad Fit ≥ 75%:**
- Match Rating: **+0.5**
- Goals For: **+8 per season**
- Goals Against: **-6 per season**
- Player Growth: **+2 to tactical attributes**

**WHEN Squad Fit < 50%:**
- Match Rating: **-0.8**
- Morale: **-15**
- Players demand transfers

**ALWAYS:**
- ❌ Refuses signings that don't fit system
- ❌ Can't change formation mid-season
- ⏱️ Requires minimum 2 seasons

**Example**: Hire him with wrong squad → Disaster Year 1. Rebuild squad → Dominate Year 2+.

---

### **2. THE PEOPLE** (Relationship Expert)
**Identity**: Happy squad wins games. Tactics secondary.

**ALWAYS:**
- Morale Baseline: **+15 to all players**
- Conflict Resolution: **Automatic**
- Rotation Acceptance: **+20** (bench players happier)

**WHEN Squad Morale ≥ 75:**
- Match Rating: **+0.3**
- Injury Recovery: **-2 weeks**
- Contract Renewals: **+30% chance**

**PENALTIES:**
- Tactical Ceiling: **7.0 max** (can't beat elite teams tactically)
- ❌ Must play star players even if out of form
- Creates future problems via over-promising

**Example**: Never win title but always finish top 6. Squad loves playing for him.

---

### **3. THE BELIEVER** (Motivation King)
**Identity**: Heart over head. High intensity, high risk.

**IN HIGH-PRESSURE GAMES** (knockouts, must-wins):
- Match Rating: **+0.7**
- Late Goals (75+ min): **+12 per season**
- Comeback Chance: **+25%**

**COST:**
- Injuries: **+8 per season**
- Player Exhaustion: **+15** (fitness drops faster)
- **Burnout Tracker**: Increments each season

**AT 3 Seasons (Burnout):**
- Match Rating: **-1.0** (complete collapse)
- Morale: **-30**
- ❌ Must sell 50%+ of squad and rebuild

**Example**: Win cup in Year 2 via miracle run. By Year 3, squad exhausted and broken. Forced to leave.

---

### **4. THE BUILDER** (Youth Obsessed)
**Identity**: Academy über alles. Long-term > short-term.

**FOR PLAYERS Age ≤ 23:**
- Attribute Growth: **+4 per season**
- Morale: **+20**
- Potential Unlock: **+5 CA beyond normal**

**FOR PLAYERS Age ≥ 28:**
- Morale: **-20** (feel neglected)
- Performance: **-0.3**
- ❌ Demand transfers

**TIMELINE:**
- Years 1-2: **-10 positions** below target (struggle)
- Years 3-4: **Break even**
- Years 5+: **+15 positions** above target (dominance)

**REQUIREMENT:**
- Board must give **4 seasons minimum**

**Example**: Finish 12th in Year 1-2 (board furious). Year 5, homegrown team wins title.

---

### **5. THE WINNER** (Results Only)
**Identity**: Ends justify means. Win ugly.

**VS TOP 6 Opponents:**
- Match Rating: **+0.6**
- Tactical Prep: **+2 bonus**
- Clean Sheets: **+8 per season vs elite**

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Immune to media/board pressure
- ✅ Will drop anyone for results

**COST:**
- Fan Approval: **-25** (boring football)
- Creative Player Morale: **-25** (hate restrictions)
- **Shelf Life: 3 seasons** max
- Creates dressing room toxicity after Year 2

**Example**: Finish 2nd playing defensively. Fans boo. Board happy. Year 3, dressing room implodes. Leaves.

## 🧮 SQUAD FIT FORMULA

**Exact calculation** - no vagueness:

```
1. For each player, check tactical style requirements
2. Player FITS if has ALL "must_have" attributes
3. Squad Fit = (Fitting Players / Total Players) × 100
```

**Thresholds:**
- **80%+**: Excellent - immediate success likely
- **65-79%**: Good - need 2-3 signings
- **50-64%**: Moderate - need 5-6 signings
- **<50%**: Poor - complete rebuild (1-2 seasons)

**Example:**
- Coach plays "Control"
- Requires: Passing ≥14, Vision ≥13, Technique ≥14
- Squad: 18 players fit, 25 total
- **Squad Fit = 72%** → "Good fit, need 2-3 technical midfielders"

---

## 👥 COACHING STAFF SYSTEM

**NEW**: Coach brings 2-3 assistants with specific bonuses:

| Staff Member | Bonus | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Assistant Coach** | Helps tactics | +5 to Tactics attribute |
| **Fitness Coach** | Reduces injuries | -3 injuries per season |
| **Sports Psychologist** | Improves morale | +10 baseline morale |
| **Set Piece Coach** | Better at set pieces | +6 goals from set pieces/season |

**Example**: The System brings Fitness Coach + Set Piece Coach = fewer injuries + more goals = better results.
