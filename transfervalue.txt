Value is uniqueness of ability, ranking and status.
I can automatically set players above a certain age to be 'Veteran' etc, and that will negatively affect their value.
The world transfer record and the highest value paid for a player in a certain position also plays a big part, 
100m is the Elite price.
Best in the world you pay double for (200m,) a price set by Neymar's transfer to PSG. There is an acknowledgement that this transfer fee, and Kylian Mbappe's transfer fee, were fraudulent/non-representative of a normal transfer market, and as such they are not considered part of the weighting.
Coutinho was signed as the Neymar replacement, while Joao Felix and Antoine Griezmann were also signed in the aftermath so can't really be considered.
This leaves transfers that are roughly of 100m defining the top end of the market.
Wages and signing on fees are massively prohibative for transfer fees in some cases. Erling Haaland and Paul Pogba's agents received commissions in the tens of millions for their parts in their players transfers, so the true 'transfer fee' must be considered a lot higher than the outlay between clubs.
