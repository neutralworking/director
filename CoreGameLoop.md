## Overview
The Director of Football role places players in the strategic leadership position of a football club, responsible for recruitment, squad planning, financial management, and long-term success—distinct from the tactical day-to-day management of matches. This creates a unique management experience focused on building sustainable success through smart decision-making.

## 1. Core DOF Responsibilities - Fully Developed Systems

### 1.1 Player Recruitment & Transfer Management

**Scout and Sign Players** fitting the club's tactical identity, budget, and wage structure involves a multi-layered system:

**Scouting Network**: Assign scouts to specific regions, leagues, or player profiles. Scout effectiveness depends on their attributes—**Judging Player Ability (JPA)** determines how accurately they assess current quality, while **Judging Player Potential (JPP)** predicts future development. Scouts with high **Adaptability** perform better in foreign markets.[4]

**Data Analysis Dashboard**: Modern football relies heavily on analytics. Players receive performance ratings, potential assessments, and market valuations. The system should display:
- Current ability vs. potential ability ratings
- Performance statistics (goals, assists, defensive actions)
- Transfer value trends over time
- Tactical suitability scores for your system

**Transfer Negotiation** operates in multiple stages:
1. **Permission Phase**: Approach club for permission to speak with player
2. **Personal Terms**: Negotiate with player's agent on wages, bonuses, contract length
3. **Transfer Fee**: Negotiate with selling club using installments, add-ons, sell-on clauses
4. **Contract Finalization**: Structure the deal with appearance fees, performance bonuses, and release clauses

**Key Attributes Required**:
- **Judging Player Ability (1-20)**: Accuracy in assessing current player quality
- **Judging Player Potential (1-20)**: Identifying future stars and wonderkids
- **Negotiation (1-20)**: Securing favorable financial terms
- **Tactical Knowledge (1-20)**: Understanding positional fit and system compatibility

**Success Metrics**: Track your **Transfer Success Rate** by grading previous signings based on three criteria:
- **Value Appreciation**: Player's transfer value increased
- **Performance Quality**: Consistent match ratings above 7.0
- **Profit Realized**: Sold for profit or contributed to team success

Grade transfers from A+ (outstanding success) to F (complete failure), building your reputation as a talent identifier.

### 1.2 Player Sales & Squad Optimization**Sell or release underperforming or high-wage players** to improve financial health. This involves strategic asset management:[1][6]

**Player Valuation System** considers multiple factors:
- **Age**: Players peak between 24-28; value declines after 30
- **Performance**: Season average ratings directly impact market value
- **Contract Length**: Longer contracts = higher value (clubs prefer security)
- **Reputation**: International caps and league performance boost value
- **Market Demand**: Popular positions (attacking players) command premiums

**Sale Strategies**:
- **Transfer List**: Attracts multiple bids, creates competition
- **Direct Negotiation**: Target specific clubs for quick sales
- **Loan Deals**: Loan with obligation/option to buy reduces immediate loss
- **Contract Termination**: For high-wage players blocking squad space
- **Free Transfers**: Players in final 6 months can leave for free

**Success Tracking**: Monitor **cumulative net spend** across your career. Consistent transfer profits build your reputation as a financial expert, unlocking opportunities at budget-conscious clubs.

### 1.3 Three-Year Squad Planning**Develop and execute a strategic squad plan** balancing immediate competitiveness with long-term sustainability:

**Squad Composition Targets**:
- **Age Profile**: Maintain target average age (typically 25-27 years)
- **Youth Integration**: Minimum percentage of players under 21
- **Domestic Player Ratio**: Meet league homegrown requirements (e.g., Premier League requires 8 homegrown in 25-man squad)[13][14]
- **Position Balance**: Ensure adequate depth across all positions

**Planning Dashboard** divides strategy into three phases:
- **Year 1**: Address immediate weaknesses and quick fixes
- **Year 2**: Optimize squad and integrate youth prospects
- **Year 3**: Peak performance phase with succession planning for aging players

**Contract Expiry Management**: Visual timeline showing when players' contracts expire, allowing proactive renewal or replacement planning. Letting contracts run down reduces transfer leverage but can force sales.[11][15]

**Success Metrics**:
- Squad age within 1 year of target
- Youth players integrated into first team
- Domestic player quotas met
- Year-over-year squad value growth

### 1.4 Staff Management & Department Oversight**Oversee staff hiring** for scouting, medical, and youth academy departments:[2][3][16]

**Staff Categories**:
- **Chief Scout**: Coordinates entire scouting network
- **Regional Scouts**: Cover specific geographic areas or leagues
- **Data Analysts**: Provide statistical insights and player recommendations
- **Head of Youth Development**: Oversees academy with critical impact on youth intake quality[17][18][19]
- **Medical Team**: Physios and sports scientists
- **Coaching Staff**: Support first team development

**Staff Assessment** (Director Attribute): Your ability to evaluate staff quality determines hiring success. Consider:[1]
- **Relevant Attributes**: JPA/JPP for scouts, tactical knowledge for coaches
- **Experience Level**: Senior staff provide better results but cost more
- **Personality**: Model professionals positively influence young players
- **Reputation**: High-reputation staff attract better prospects

**Performance Management**: Conduct quarterly reviews of staff effectiveness. Scout performance is measured by quality of recommendations; youth staff by intake quality; medical staff by injury prevention.[4][18]

### 1.5 Contract & Wage Structure Management**Negotiate contracts efficiently** to manage club wage-to-turnover ratio:[20][21][12]

**Wage Structure Tiers** maintain internal harmony:[22][20]
- **Star Players**: Top earners (e.g., £40-50k/week at Championship level)
- **First Team Core**: Regular starters (£20-30k/week)
- **Squad Rotation**: Backup options (£10-15k/week)  
- **Youth Prospects**: Development contracts (£2-5k/week)

**Contract Negotiation Tools**:[23][24][20]
- **Squad Status**: Determines initial wage demands (Key Player > First Team > Squad Player > Youngster)
- **Appearance Bonuses**: Pay per match played (reduces base wage pressure)
- **Performance Bonuses**: Goals, assists, clean sheets (incentivizes performance)
- **Achievement Bonuses**: League position, European qualification (ties pay to success)
- **Signing-On Fees**: One-time payment to reduce weekly wages
- **Contract Length**: Longer contracts allow lower wages but less flexibility

**Financial Compliance**: UEFA recommends keeping wage-to-turnover ratio below 70%. Exceeding 80% triggers financial restrictions. Track this metric religiously:[21][12][22]

**Wage-to-Turnover Ratio = (Total Annual Wages / Total Annual Revenue) × 100**

**Negotiation Savings Tracker**: Record the difference between initial player demands and final agreed terms. Cumulative savings demonstrate your negotiating prowess.[25][20]

### 1.6 Manager Appointment & SupportWhile not explicitly detailed in your original brief, the DOF typically **supports the head coach** with player profiles matching tactical philosophies:[1][2][7]

**Tactical Alignment**:
- Define club playing style (possession, counter-attack, pressing)
- Identify formation preferences (4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, 3-5-2)
- Specify key position requirements (ball-playing center-back, target man striker)

**Player Profiling**: Match potential signings to tactical needs using attribute analysis. A possession-based system requires high Passing, Vision, and Technique; a counter-attacking system prioritizes Pace, Acceleration, and Dribbling.[26]

**Collaboration**: Regular meetings with the coach to discuss squad needs and provide feedback on signed players. Coach satisfaction affects your board standing.[24][27]

**Manager Recruitment**: When performance falters, the DOF may need to hire a new manager. Success here directly impacts league position, for which you bear 70% responsibility through manager choice and squad quality.[1]

### 1.7 Financial Stability & Board Relations**Ensure financial stability** while maintaining or improving league position:[1][28]

**Financial Dashboard Tracks**:
- **Revenue Streams**: Matchday, commercial, broadcasting, prize money

**Board Meetings & Reporting**: Quarterly reviews assess your progress. Use your **Charisma** attribute to present results effectively and maintain confidence. High charisma helps secure budget increases and infrastructure improvements.[7][30][29]

**Board Confidence System** (0-100%):[29][27]
- **High Confidence (80%+)**: Contract extensions offered, budget increases approved
- **Medium Confidence (50-79%)**: Adequate support, expectations maintained  
- **Low Confidence (<50%)**: Job at risk, budget restrictions, media pressure

### 5.3 Wage-to-Turnover Ratio Management**UEFA Financial Sustainability** requires clubs maintain wages below 70% of revenue:[21][12][22]

**Calculation**:
**Wage-to-Turnover Ratio = (Total Annual Wages / Total Annual Revenue) × 100**

**Example**:
- Total wages: £80M
