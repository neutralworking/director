# Stage Two - Analysed Value To Club (AVTC) is a currency value that extrapolates the player's OverallTransferScore, a metric for suitability for a specific club. This will ultimately be displayed on the scouting report.
The Director will look to buy players that have a much higher AVTC than Market Value.
